        <p class="mtabout"> In recent years, technology has improved to allow for a proliferation of recycling processes, particularly for plastic such as bottles of drinks and wrapping. Our app is also an economical alternative for suppliers, users, councils, and environment. We called the app “money tree”. Money tree works with an inclusive because it decreases environmentally harmful pollution as a social responsibility project. This MVP project attracts early-adopter customers, and businesses and validate a product idea early in the product development cycle. The app will collect the scores by scanning the barcode of plastic bottles and give them back to the shopping center. People through the stored scores can buy similar products with discount or cheaper. This project in the future can be developed for recycling glass bottles(casestudy:coca cola, as a international brand).
